> HelioVolt – Smart, Sustainable Powerbank Manufacturing
Our project is all about making powerbanks smarter, better, and greener. At its core, it's a system designed to simplify and speed up the manufacturing process of high-quality, eco-friendly powerbanks. We’ve built tools that help monitor assembly lines in real-time, check product quality instantly, and reduce production errors — all while keeping the workflow smooth and efficient.

The real problem we’re tackling is the flood of cheap, unreliable powerbanks in the market that don’t last long and contribute to electronic waste. With HelioVolt, we’re focusing on sustainable materials, smarter energy management, and a manufacturing process that’s both cost-effective and environmentally conscious.

Why is it cool? Because it blends clean tech, automation, and real-world impact. We’re not just building powerbanks — we’re powering a future where devices last longer, work smarter, and are built with the planet in mind.

Acknowledgements
We’d like to thank everyone who supported us throughout this project.

A special thanks to Design with Zaid on YouTube, whose tutorials really helped us get started with Figma and understand the basics of design. Since we were new to the platform, we spent most of our time exploring and building the design itself — and as a result, we weren’t able to complete the coding side of the project.

Still, this was a great learning experience. We got a solid introduction to UI/UX, understood the flow of product design
